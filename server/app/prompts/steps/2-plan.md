Based on the user story {STORY_ID} that we just reviewed, use the playwright-test-planner
agent to:

1. Read the application URL and test credentials (if any) from the user story
2. Explore the application and understand all workflows mentioned in the acceptance
   criteria. Set up the browser with planner_setup_page using
   seedFile "{SEED}" and project "{CHROMIUM_PROJECT}" (the seed already opens the app
   at {BASE_URL})
3. Create a comprehensive test plan that covers all acceptance criteria including:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Negative scenarios (validation errors, empty fields, invalid data)
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Navigation flow tests
   - UI element validation

4. Save the test plan as: {PLAN_FILE}

Ensure each test scenario includes:
- Clear test case title
- Detailed step-by-step instructions
- Expected results for each step
- Test data requirements
- The stable locators found (following this target's locator convention)
