# End-to-End QA Workflow with Natural Language

## Workflow Overview

This prompt guides you through a complete 7-step QA workflow using MCP servers and AI agents to go from user story to committed automated test scripts.

---

## 🎯 STEP 1: Read User Story

**Prompt:**

```
I need to start a new testing workflow. Please read the user story from the file:
user-stories/scrum-latest.md

Summarize the key requirements, acceptance criteria, and testing scope.
```

**Expected Output:**

- Summary of the user story
- List of acceptance criteria
- Application URL and test credentials
- Key features to test

---



## 📄 STEP 2: Create Test Plan

**Prompt:**

```
Based on the user story SCRUM-101 that we just reviewed, use the playwright-test-planner
agent to:

1. Read the application URL and test credentials from the user story
2. Explore the application and understand all workflows mentioned in the acceptance
criteria
3. Create a comprehensive test plan that covers all acceptance criteria including:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Negative scenarios (validation errors, empty fields, invalid data)
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Navigation flow tests
   - UI element validation

4. Save the test plan as: specs/saucedemo-checkout-test-plan.md

Ensure each test scenario includes:
- Clear test case title
- Detailed step-by-step instructions
- Expected results for each step
- Test data requirements
```

**Expected Output:**

- Complete test plan markdown file saved to specs/
- Organized test scenarios with clear structure
- Browser exploration screenshots (if needed)

---



## 🧪 STEP 3: Perform Exploratory Testing

**Prompt:**

```
Now I need to perform manual exploratory testing using Playwright MCP browser tools.

Please read the test plan from: specs/saucedemo-checkout-test-plan.md

Then execute the test scenarios defined in that plan:
1. Use Playwright browser tools to manually execute each test scenario from the plan
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in each test case
3. Verify expected results match actual results
4. Take screenshots at key steps and error states
5. Document your findings:
   - Test execution results for each scenario
   - Any UI inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors
   - Missing validations or bugs discovered
   - Screenshots as evidence
```

**Expected Output:**

- Manual test execution results
- Screenshots of the application at various states
- List of observations and findings
- Any issues discovered during exploration

---



## ⚙️ STEP 4: Generate Automation Scripts

**Prompt:**

```
Now I need to create automated test scripts using the playwright-test-generator agent.

Please review:
1. Test plan from: specs/saucedemo-checkout-test-plan.md (for test scenarios and steps)
2. Exploratory testing results from Step 3 (for actual element selectors and UI insights)

Using insights from the manual exploratory testing:
- Leverage the element selectors and locators that were successfully used in Step 3
- Use stable element properties (IDs, data attributes, roles) discovered during exploration
- Apply wait strategies and UI behaviors observed during manual testing
- Incorporate any workarounds for UI quirks discovered

Generate Playwright JavaScript automation scripts:
1. Create scripts for each test scenario from the test plan
2. Organize scripts into appropriate test suite files in: tests/saucedemo-checkout/
3. Use the test case names and steps from the test plan
4. Use reliable selectors and strategies from exploratory testing

Requirements for all scripts:
- Follow Playwright best practices
- Include proper assertions using expect()
- Use descriptive test names matching the format in the test plan
- Use robust element selectors discovered during manual testing
- Add comments for complex steps
- Use proper wait strategies based on actual application behavior
- Add proper test hooks (beforeEach, afterEach)
- Configure for multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

After generating the scripts, run the tests to verify they pass.
```

**Expected Output:**

- Test suite files created in tests/saucedemo-checkout/ based on test plan scenarios
- Scripts using robust selectors discovered during exploratory testing
- All scripts follow Playwright best practices
- Initial test generation complete

---



## 🔧 STEP 5: Execute and Heal Automation Tests

**Prompt:**

```
Now I need to execute the generated automation scripts and heal any failures using the
playwright-test-healer agent.

1. Run all automation scripts in: tests/saucedemo-checkout/
2. Identify any failing tests
3. For each failing test, use the playwright-test-healer agent to:
   - Analyze the failure (selector issues, timing issues, assertion failures)
   - Auto-heal the test by fixing selectors, adding waits, or adjusting assertions
   - Update the test script with the fixes
4. Re-run the healed tests to verify they pass
5. Repeat the heal process until all tests are stable and passing
6. Document:
   - Initial test results (pass/fail count)
   - Healing activities performed
   - Final test results after healing
   - Any tests that couldn't be auto-healed
```

**Expected Output:**

- All automation tests executed
- Failing tests identified and healed using test-healer agent
- Healed test scripts updated in tests/saucedemo-checkout/
- Final stable test execution results
- Summary of healing activities performed

---



## 📊 STEP 6: Create Test Report

**Prompt:**

```
Now I need to create a comprehensive test execution report based on manual testing,
automation execution, and healing activities.

Please compile results from:
- Step 3: Manual exploratory testing results
- Step 4: Generated automation scripts
- Step 5: Automated test execution and healing results

Structure the report as: test-results/SCRUM-101-checkout-test-report.md

Include:
1. Executive Summary
   - Total test cases planned
   - Test cases executed (manual + automated)
   - Overall Pass/Fail/Blocked status

2. Manual Test Results
   - Results from Step 3 exploratory testing
   - Screenshots and observations
   - Issues found during manual testing

3. Automated Test Results
   - Initial automation results from Step 5
   - Healing activities performed
   - Final test execution results after healing
   - Test suite execution summary
   - Pass/Fail count for each test suite

4. Defects Log
   - For any failed tests (manual or automated):
     * Bug ID
     * Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
     * Title and Description
     * Steps to Reproduce
     * Expected vs Actual Behavior
     * Screenshots/Evidence
     * Environment Details

5. Test Coverage Analysis
   - Which acceptance criteria are covered
   - Coverage from manual vs automated tests
   - Any gaps in test coverage
   - Recommendations for additional testing

6. Summary and Recommendations
   - Overall quality assessment
   - Risk areas
   - Next steps
```

**Expected Output:**

- Comprehensive test execution report covering both manual and automated testing
- Clear PASS/FAIL status for all test scenarios
- Detailed bug reports for failures
- Complete test coverage analysis
- Evidence and screenshots attached
